# The payload is rendered per stack by scaffold_wp_starter (netdust-wp-manager):
# {{GATE_WP_DIR}} -> web/wp | app/wp, {{GATE_CONTENT_DIR}} -> web/app | app/content,
# {{SLUG*}} -> the site slug. A hardcoded `web/app` is correct-by-coincidence on a
# Bedrock render and BROKEN on a stackwp one — and nothing downstream notices until
# a stackwp scaffold's gate goes red. This lint is the pre-push catch.

# Usage (from the payload repo root):  sh gate/bin/lint-tokens.sh
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = literals found (each printed as file:line:match).
